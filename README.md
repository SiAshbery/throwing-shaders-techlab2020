# throwing-shaders
## Techlab2020

This repo contains a few example shaders from my Techlab2020 talk for Red Badger.

Some shaders were written by me, while others have been sourced from Shader Toy under MIT and Commons liscense. Externally sourced shaders are credited in the shader file themselves.

Each shader is written in GLSL and can be previewed using [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), [GLSL Sandbox](http://glslsandbox.com/), [The ShaderToy preview addon for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevensona.shader-toy#:~:text=To%20run%20the%20command%2C%20either,Preview%22%20from%20the%20context%20menu.) or any other glsl capable platform.
